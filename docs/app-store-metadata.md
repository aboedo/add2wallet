## Description
Turn any PDF into an Apple Wallet pass in seconds.

Boarding passes, concert tickets, event confirmations, ferry reservations — if it's a PDF, Add2Wallet can convert it into a beautiful, scannable Apple Wallet pass with all the details extracted automatically.

HOW IT WORKS
1. Open a PDF from Files, Safari, or any app
2. Share it with Add2Wallet (or open it directly)
3. AI reads your document and extracts all the details
4. Get a ready-to-use Apple Wallet pass with barcode, date, venue, and more

SMART EXTRACTION
• AI-powered — automatically detects event type, date, time, venue, seat info, and barcodes
• Supports QR codes, barcodes, and Aztec codes from your original document
• Multi-ticket support — PDFs with multiple passengers generate individual passes
• Color-matched passes that look great in your wallet

ALWAYS ACCESSIBLE
• Your passes live in Apple Wallet — available offline, no app needed
• Location-based notifications when you arrive at the venue
• All your converted passes saved in the app for easy re-adding

PRIVACY FIRST
• PDFs are processed and immediately deleted — nothing is stored on our servers
• No account required, no tracking, no analytics
