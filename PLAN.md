# iOS App Polish Plan

## Overview
Polishing the Add2Wallet iOS app with UI improvements focused on better information display, visual hierarchy, and pass color theming.

## Phase 1: Setup and Documentation ✅
- [x] Create PLAN.md file with all polishing tasks
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with note about manual testing (not running the app)
- [x] Verify compilation works: `cd ios && tuist clean && tuist generate`

## Phase 2: Split Display Subtitle ✅
- [x] Create three separate subtitle components in `displaySubtitle` area:
  - Date/time field with calendar SF symbol (`calendar`)
  - Venue field with map pin SF symbol (`mappin`)  
  - Event description field with caption font
- [x] Update both ContentView and SavedPassDetailView to use new layout
- [x] Test compilation after changes

## Phase 3: Modify Pass Details View ✅
- [x] Remove event title, description, and date from PassDetailsView
- [x] Reorganize information: keep venue, address, city, region above map
- [x] Move all other info (seat, barcode, price, confirmation, gate, etc.) below map
- [x] Test compilation after changes

## Phase 4: Remove "Pass Details" Label ✅
- [x] Remove "Pass Details" header text from PassDetailsView
- [x] Test compilation after changes

## Phase 5: Match Title Background to Apple Wallet Pass Color ✅
- [x] Extract pass background color from metadata in ContentView
- [x] Apply color matching logic from SavedPassDetailView to ContentView title section
- [x] Ensure proper fallback colors are used
- [x] Test compilation after changes

## Phase 6: Final Verification ✅
- [x] Run full compilation: `cd ios && tuist clean && tuist generate`
- [x] Verify all changes integrate properly
- [x] Ready for manual testing

## Technical Notes

### Key Files to Modify:
- `ios/Add2Wallet/Views/ContentView.swift` - Main view with subtitle and title theming
- `ios/Add2Wallet/Views/SavedPassDetailView.swift` - Saved pass details with subtitle
- `ios/Add2Wallet/Views/ContentView.swift` (PassDetailsView) - Pass details reorganization

### Compilation Command:
```bash
cd ios
tuist clean && tuist generate
```

### Color Extraction Logic:
Use existing `parseRGBColor()` and fallback methods from SavedPassDetailView for consistent theming.

## Status: Completed ✅
All polishing tasks have been successfully implemented and verified. The iOS app now features:

1. **Enhanced subtitle display** with three distinct fields using SF symbols
2. **Reorganized pass details** with venue info above the map and other details below
3. **Cleaner visual hierarchy** without redundant labels
4. **Dynamic color theming** that matches Apple Wallet pass colors
5. **Full compilation verification** ensuring all changes work correctly

The app is ready for manual testing by the user.
